#Day23ofMyLeetCodeJourney â€“ Problem 1876: Substrings of Size 3 with Distinct Characters

Today's challenge was a simple yet interesting string-based logic problem.
 It tested my ability to slide through substrings and check for uniqueness efficiently.

ðŸ§¾ Problem Summary:
Given a string s, return the count of "good substrings" of length 3.
 A good substring is one where all three characters are different.

ðŸ’¡ My Thought Process:
Use a sliding window of size 3.
At each step, check if all 3 characters are distinct.
If yes, increase the count!

ðŸ§ª Example:
Input: "xyzaz"
 Substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yza", "zaz"
 âœ… Good one: "xyz"
 Output: 1

ðŸ§  What I Practiced:
Sliding window technique
Identifying patterns in substrings
Practicing simple but precise logic with conditions
